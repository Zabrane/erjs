<h3>About</h3>

<p>Er.js piggybacks on Neil Mix&#8217;s <a
href="http://www.neilmix.com/2007/02/07/threading-in-javascript-17/">Thread.js</a>
which fakes threading in JavaScript 1.7 using coroutines and nested generator
continuations.  The goal is to replicate Erlang&#8217;s concurrent lockless
process model and message-passing APIs in JavaScript.</p>

<h3>Running Concurrently</h3>

<p>Running a JavaScript function in the background is easy with Er.js:</p>

<pre><big><strong>Er.spawn</strong>(myBackgroundFunction);</big></pre>

<p><code>Er.spawn</code> starts a new Er.js process running
<code>myBackgroundFunction</code>, and returns its process id.  </p>

<p>Because processes are really coroutines, you have to call <code>yield</code>
before any function which might block.  Calling <code>yield</code> will create a
continuation trampoline that can be rerun by Er.js when it&#8217;s time for the
process to continue executing.  For example:</p>

<pre><big>function myBackgroundFunction() {
   // Wait for 4 seconds
   <strong>yield Er.sleep</strong>(4000);
   // Do other things&#8230;
}</big></pre>

<h3>Sending Messages</h3>

<p>In Erlang and Er.js, each process has a built-in message queue that other
processes use to send it messages.  Posting to the message queue never blocks
the caller, and the destination process for the message can read them off the
queue whenever it wants.  Messages are just regular associative arrays, similar
to hashtables, which are easy to create in JavaScript.  For example:</p>

<pre><big><strong>Er.send</strong>(myPid, { Hello: new Date(), From: Er.pid() });</big></pre>

<p>Here, <code>myPid</code> is assumed to be the process id from some former
call to <code>Er.spawn</code>.  This call sends a message with the keys
&#8220;Hello&#8221; and &#8220;From&#8221;.  <code>Hello</code> is a
<code>Date</code> object with the current date, and <code>From</code> is the
process id of the current process, which can always be fetched with
<code>Er.pid()</code>.  Passing the current pid means the <code>myPid</code>
process can send us messages in return, since we&#8217;ve told it who we
are.</p>

<h3>Receiving & Pattern Matching</h3>

<p>When <code>myBackgroundFunction</code> wants to read off its message queue,
it calls the <code>Er.receive</code> function, telling it the kind of message
it&#8217;s interested in, and a function to call when such a message is
received.  Interest in a message is expressed using a message pattern which,
just like the messages themselves, is a simple hash table.</p>

<pre><big><strong>yield Er.receive</strong>({ Hello: Date, From: _ },     // pattern
                 function(msg) {               // handler
                    log(&#8221;Hello=&#8221; + msg.Hello);
                    log(&#8221;From=&#8221; + msg.From);
                 });</big></pre>

<p>This matches any message in the current process&#8217;s queue which has a
<code>Hello</code> key with a <code>Date</code> object as the value, and with a
<code>From</code> key with any value.  Explicit value matching for number and
string literals and object references is also possible.  The &#8220;_&#8221; for
the <code>From</code> key means that any value is accepted.  There are a few
other matching rules as well that make this a very powerful but simple message
dispatching mechanism.</p>

<p>If a message in the process queue matches a pattern passed to
<code>Er.receive</code>, it is passed to the handler function found in the
argument list following the pattern.  The handler can look up the key values it
needs in order to act on the message.  It can also send messages to other
processes, spawn new processes, receive queued messages or perform other work.
</p>
<p>Because the <code>Er.receive</code> call doesn&#8217;t finish until a message
matching one of patterns is received and handled, we put a <code>yield</code> in
front of the call to avoid blocking other processes.</p>

<h3>Linked Processes</h3>

<p>When a process finishes or exits, it automatically sends a message to any
processes which link to it.  Linking is done by passing a pid to
<code>Er.link</code>.  The sent message is of the form:</p>

<pre><big>{ Signal: Er.Exit, From: exiting_pid, Reason: reason }</big></pre>

<p>The <code>Reason</code> value comes either from the exiting process calling
<code>Er.exit(reason)</code>, or just <code>throw</code>'ing the reason as an
exception.  If the linking process does not handle this message, it will exit
itself, sending exit messages to its own linked processes.  This allows for
simple process chaining and failure handling.</p>

<h3>Message Multicast</h3>

<p>Er.js Processes can also register to receive messages sent to a given name string,
using <code>Er.register(name)</code>.  Registered names can be passed as the
first argument to <code>Er.send</code>.  Multiple processes can register for the
same name, and they will all receive a message sent to that name, allowing for
simple multi-casting.</p>

<h3>Future Work: AJAX & Threading</h3>

<p>Going forward, Er.js will wrap certain long-running asynchronous JavaScript
calls in synchronous yielding wrappers so that processes can avoid convoluted
asynchronous code.</p>

<p>XmlHttpRequest, AJAX and JSON should integrate nicely with the process and
message-passing model.  This will allow processes to avoid asynchronous
callbacks, instead using <code>Er.send</code> and <code>Er.receive</code> as
with other messages.  For example:</p>

<pre><big>rpc = <strong>Er.spawn</strong>("http://www.beatniksoftware.com/echo");
<strong>Er.send</strong>(rpc, { Echo: "This is the echo payload" });

<strong>yield Er.receive</strong>({ EchoResponse: String },
                 function (msg) {
                    alert("Got Echo response: " + msg.EchoResponse);
                 });
</big></pre>

<p>For DOM Events, this might be embodied with the following, where
<code>"button1"</code> below could alternately be an element id, DOM node, CSS
selector, etc:</p>

<pre><big><strong>Er.link_event</strong>("button1", "click");

<strong>yield Er.receive</strong>({ Signal: Er.Event, From: _, Event: "click" },
                 function (msg) {
                    alert("Got Click event from: " + msg.From);
                 });
</big></pre>

<p>It would also be interesting to explore the use of native threads for running
processes, leveraging e.g. Google Gears' <a
href="http://code.google.com/apis/gears/api_workerpool.html">WorkerPools</a> if
available on the client.</p>
